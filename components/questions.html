                    </h5>

                        from city to city. For example, this means that living in Paphos might be a bit
                        cheaper than living in Limassol. </p>

                        finish.</p>

                        according to the naturalization scheme based on years of residence (M127). Once
                        acquired, permanent residency in Cyprus is valid for life.</p>
